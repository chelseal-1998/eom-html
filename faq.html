    <h2>Property FAQ's</h2>
    <br />
    <p>
      <b>1. What the first step of the home buying process? </b><br />

      Getting pre-approved for a mortgage is the first step of the home buying
      <br />
      process. Getting a pre-approval letter from a lender get the ball
      rolling<br />
      in the right direction.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      <b> 2. How long does it take to buy a home? </b><br />

      From start (searching online) to finish (closing escrow), buying a home
      <br />
      takes about 10 to 12 weeks. Once a home is selected an the offer is <br />
      accepted, the average time to complete the escrow period on a home is 30
      <br />
      to 45 days (under normal market conditions). Though, well-prepared home
      <br />
      buyers who pay cash have been known to purchase properties faster than
      <br />
      that.

      <b> 3. How much do I have to pay an agent to help me buy a house? </b
      ><br />

      Home shoppers pay little or no fees to an agent to buy a home.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      <b> 4. How many homes should I view before buying one? </b><br />

      That’s up to you! For sure, home shopping today is easier today than ever
      <br />
      before. The ability to search for homes online and see pictures, even
      <br />
      before setting a foot outside the comfort of your living room, has
      <br />
      completely changed the home buying game. Convenience is at an all-time
      <br />
      high. But, nothing beats visiting a home to see how it looks and ‘feels’
      <br />
      in person.

      <b> 5. How long can the seller take to respond to my offer? </b><br />

      Written offers should stipulate the timeframe in which the seller should
      <br />
      respond. Giving them twenty-four hours should be sufficient.
